        <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>This are some but a few of things that we do.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Animal Shelter </strong>– Many animals in Kenya suffer from neglect, cruelty and abuse. We run a shelter for animals in need; such as lost animals or victims of cruelty. We provide care and a safe environment until animals are reclaimed or re-homed to carefully vetted new owners.</li>
               </br>
              <li><strong>Investigations and Rescue </strong>– We respond to over 6000 calls per year to give help and advice to owners on pet care.</li>
                </br>
              <li><strong>Education & Advocacy </strong>– We arrange and encourage school visits to the shelter to teach children about the importance of animal welfare.</li>
               </br>
              <li><strong>Spay/Neuter Campaigns </strong>– We feel strongly that overpopulation of cats and dogs should be controlled by sterilization rather than by the killing of healthy animals. The Ruiru-wellfare conducts spay and neuter campaigns in lower income areas when funds are available.</li>
               </br>
              <li><strong>Humane Slaughter </strong>– Ruiru's-fare was instrumental in introducing humane slaughter of livestock to Kenya. After having seen the way animals suffer in abattoirs, we embarked on a humane slaughter programme promoting the use of captive bolt pistols. We import captive bolt pistols and blank ammunition, which are sold to abattoirs at cost price. Our inspectors teach slaughter house staff on proper use of captive bolt pistols and their maintenance.</li>
            </ul>
